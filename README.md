**Kautilya-ERP** is a learning-driven **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** project aimed at building a practical system for **billing, inventory, and business automation**.  
This project is not a ready-made product yet — it is being developed **from scratch** to understand how real ERP systems are designed and scaled.

---

### 📍 Where the Project Currently Stands (Honest State)

Right now, Kautilya-ERP is in its **foundation phase**.

The repository currently contains:
- A GitHub repository properly initialized
- A basic folder structure for future ERP modules
- Python environment setup
- Early experimentation with:
  - Python scripts
  - File handling
  - Desktop UI concepts (Tkinter / CustomTkinter)
- Active learning of Git & GitHub:
  - cloning repositories
  - commits
  - push / pull
  - collaboration with teammates

⚠️ No complete ERP module is finished yet.  
The focus so far has been **learning + planning + setup**, not feature completion.

---

### ✅ What Is Done So Far

✔ Repository created and structured  
✔ Git & GitHub workflow understood and practiced  
✔ Python installed, tested, and running  
✔ Initial code experiments added  
✔ ERP modules planned conceptually (Billing, Inventory, Users)  
✔ Desktop-based ERP approach decided  
✔ FIFO inventory logic planned (not coded yet)

### 🛠 Tech Stack (Current → Planned)

Python → Tkinter / CustomTkinter → SQLite → MySQL → Cloud (future)

This project starts **simple**, then grows **step by step**, just like real systems.

### 🎯 Vision Behind Kautilya-ERP

The goal is **not just to build software**, but to:
- Understand how real ERP systems work
- Learn backend logic used in businesses
- Create a base that can later scale into:
  - GST billing
  - Reports & analytics
  - Cloud-based ERP
  - Web & mobile versions

---

### 🤝 Collaboration

This repository is **open for learning-based collaboration**.  
Contributors are welcome to learn, experiment, and improve together.
